# GRUs-Minions-Capstone
This repository is for Team GRU's minions to complete research and programing as a team for our fentanyl epidemic OCR/NLP Project. 

## Description
Currently, our goal is to expand on what was completed for the project in Spring 2024. To proceed with the project, GRU's Minions will need to be able to figure out how to extract entities from images and how to properly handle unstructured text so that it is not manually intensive and error-prone. It is also know that the evidence from Spring 2024 was not fully exploited.
